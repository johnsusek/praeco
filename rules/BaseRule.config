# BaseRule.config - Global configuration for all ElastAlert2 rules
#
# This file contains common settings that will be applied to every rule created in Praeco.
# Any configuration option you put here will be inherited by all rules.
# See https://elastalert2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html for all available options.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file can be left completely empty (or with all settings commented out) without causing errors.
#            The fix implemented in this PR ensures that:
#            1. If BaseRule.config doesn't exist, rules will work without it
#            2. If BaseRule.config exists but is empty/commented, rules will work with their own settings
#            3. Only uncomment and configure the settings you actually need
#            All settings below are optional and commented out by default.

# You can uncomment and configure any of the settings below as needed.
# If you don't need a setting, you can leave it commented out or delete it entirely.
